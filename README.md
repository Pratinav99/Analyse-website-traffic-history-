## Project Overview
This project aims to apply five forecasting techniques to predict future website traffic based on historical data. The analysis involves using daily visitor statistics to forecast unique visits. The dataset spans nearly six years, providing valuable insights into the website's performance and user engagement over time.

## Forecasting Techniques Used
- Linear Regression
- Moving Average Method
- Exponential Smoothing
- ARIMA/SARIMA
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

##  Conclusion
Among all the methods applied, the LSTM model stands out for its high accuracy in forecasting website traffic. This is due to its ability to understand and leverage patterns over time in the data. SARIMA also performs well, capturing both non-seasonal and seasonal components effectively. On the other hand, linear regression and simpler models like moving averages and exponential smoothing, though useful in certain contexts, do not perform as well on this dataset.
